# WaterCup
<p>

My first and final Android project I created for CSC 472 Android Development I at Depaul University.

<p>
Watercup is a basic fluid consumption tracker that allows users to keep track of both sugary fluids and water consumption. The UI design is simple with large, colorful buttons that are easy to press when you are active or on the go. Watercup features include an alarm reminder, a pie chart to compare your sugary fluid intake versus your water intake, and a user profile that is easily configurable and calculates the goal amount of fluids a user should aim to consume daily. The tracker refreshes its count everyday but your goal remains the same unless configured.

<p>
	There is also a basic weather widget that displays the current weather at the users' current location, allowing the user to plan their fluid consumptions accordingly (i.e. if its hot, plan to bring and drink more water!). The weather widget uses OpenWeather API.

<b>Status</b>: Complete

<b>What I would like to change/do differently in future</b>: 
<ul>
	<li>Change the usage of Async thread to a faster thread for better performance</li>
	<li>Make the alarm reminder more configurable, such as being able to choose a custom date and time for a reminder to be pushed</li>
	<li>Make the alarm reminder more accurate. Currently, the alarm reminder is not exact and rings at estimated intervals.</li>
	<li>Change the UI Design to be more interactive.</li>
</ul>
